Description:
You are tasked with creating a spell checker program that takes a text file containing a list of correctly spelled words
and uses a hash table to efficiently check whether words in another text file are
 spelled correctly or not.


 You can assume that each word in the dictionary file is unique and there are no duplicates.

Requirements:

Create a hash table data structure in Java to store the dictionary of correctly spelled words.
Implement a method to read the dictionary file and populate the hash table with the words.
Implement a method to read another text file containing words to be checked.
For each word in the input file, check if it exists in the hash table. If it does not, print the misspelled word.
Measure the performance of your spell checker by analyzing the time it takes to check a large text file for misspelled words.
Bonus:

Implement a simple hashing function to generate hash codes for the words.
Experiment with different hash table sizes and collision resolution strategies to optimize performance.
Handle punctuation and case sensitivity appropriately.
Provide suggestions for misspelled words based on similarity metrics like Levenshtein distance.
